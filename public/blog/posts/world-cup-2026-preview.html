    The 2026 World Cup is shaping up to be the biggest international football tournament
    ever, with an expanded format, more matches, and more countries competing for the
    sport’s most prestigious trophy.
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    This will be the first World Cup jointly hosted by three nations, making it a truly
    global tournament across an entire continent.
  </div>

  <h2>Host Nations: USA, Canada, and Mexico</h2>

  <p>
    The 2026 World Cup will be hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This marks
    the first time the tournament will be shared between three countries, dramatically
    expanding both the geographic footprint and the number of host cities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The United States will host the majority of matches, including most of the knockout-stage
    games. Mexico makes history by becoming the first nation to host World Cup matches in
    three different tournaments, while Canada will host World Cup matches for the first
    time ever.
  </p>

  <h2>Tournament Favorites</h2>

  <p>
    As with every World Cup, several teams are already being discussed as favorites based
    on their recent performances, squad depth, and international pedigree.
  </p>

  <h3>England</h3>
  <p>
    England enters the tournament with a talented core of players who have consistently
    reached the latter stages of major tournaments in recent years. With a strong blend of
    youth and experience, they are viewed by many as serious contenders to go all the way.
  </p>

  <h3>France</h3>
  <p>
    France remains one of the most complete teams in international football, combining
    technical quality, athleticism, and tournament experience. Their depth across every
    position makes them one of the most dangerous sides in knockout football.
  </p>

  <h3>Argentina</h3>
  <p>
    Argentina will enter the competition as one of the teams everyone wants to watch.
    Known for their tactical discipline and history of producing world-class attackers,
    they will once again be considered capable of making a deep run in the tournament.
  </p>

  <h3>Spain</h3>
<p>
Spain enters the 2026 World Cup as one of the most technically gifted teams in the
world. Known for their possession-based style of play and emphasis on controlling
the tempo of matches, Spain consistently develops players who are comfortable on the
ball in high-pressure situations.

With a strong pipeline of young talent mixed with experienced international players,
Spain has the balance and cohesion to challenge any opponent. Many expect them to be
serious contenders, especially if they find their rhythm early in the tournament.
