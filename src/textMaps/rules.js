    body: (
      <p>
        A bracket must be theoretically possible to occur in real life to be
        valid.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some examples include:
        <br />
        - Picking a champion that you did not pick to participate in the final
        <br />
        - Placing a team in the playoff bracket that you placed last in their
        group
        <br />
        - Placing the same team on the playoff bracket in multiple spots in the
        same round
        <br />
        <br />
        If your bracket contains one of these or other similarly impossible
        scenarios then it is invalid.
        <br />
        <br />
        A bracket that has not been completely filled out (i.e. one or more
        teams in the playoff bracket are still listed as &quot;Winner&quot;, or
        all bonus picks have not been selected) is considered to be a valid
        bracket. No points will be awarded for the missing items, but it will
        still be in contention for the leaderboard.
        <br />
        <br />
        Brackets are only checked for validity during official scoring at which
        point it will be too late to amend your bracket. If submitting a custom
        bracket to our open API you must check it for validity yourself. Invalid
        brackets are not eligible for the leaderboard and are subject to
        disqualification.

      <p>
        This bonus is based on which individual player scores the most goals in
        the tournament. If there is an official golden boot (or similar award
        for top goalscorer) handed out by the tournament then the winner will be
        based on that, with any tiebreakers coming from those official rules.
        <br />
        If there is no official award then only goals scored will be counted, no
        tiebreakers will be applied. In the case of a tie all submissions
        picking any of the correct teams will be awarded full points.

    header: "Worst Discipline",
    body: (
      <p>
        For soccer brackets a worst discipline bonus pick may be implemented.
        This will be calculated using a points system. 1 point will be awarded
        for each yellow card the team receives, 2 points for each red card. Only
        cards awarded to players will count towards this total. Any cards given
        to coaching staff or disciplinary action taken against unruly fans will
        not be considered.
        <br />
        In the case of a tie on points the team with the most red cards will be
        considered to have the worst discipline. If it is still tied then all
        submissions which picked any of the tied teams will be awarded full
        points.
