      <p>
        A bracket must be theoretically possible to occur in real life to be
        valid. For example: if you pick a team as your champion but did not pick
        that team to participate in the final, or if you place a team in the
        playoff bracket that you picked to finish last in their group your
        bracket is invalid.
        <br />
        Invalid brackets are not eligible for the leaderboard and are subject to
        deletion.
